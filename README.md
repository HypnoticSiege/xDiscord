 Another FiveM Discord RPC.
Made by HypnoticSiege (Things included from sadboilogan's Rich Presence https://github.com/sadboilogan/FiveM-RichPresence)
This Rich Presence will not show the vehicle type in order to not leak any spawncodes you might want private as I see that as a problem on some servers.
For looks I have added Icons which change according to your player's status!

THIS COMES READY OUT OF THE BOX
You can add just this script to your server without configuring anything and it will work!
Yet, if you want your own you can go to the Discord Developer Portal and add the icons from the Assets Folder for this to work on you app.

If you need any help please contact me on Discord (HypnoticSiege#2909) or make a Contact Request on my site (https://hypnoticsiege.codes/contact/),
Cheers Guys!
